I felt like using JavaScript today. Its not a formal programming assignment, so it probably doesn't matter and you probably don't need to run it.

There are 2 output files with some details/trace of how the algorithm is working. It is walking through the steps.

Here is how to run it:

- You would need to have Node.js installed
- After that just run `node kmeans.mjs` or `node agglomerative.mjs`
- It will print to the console and flush output to either of the two files

Also, I am aware that I am submitting late again. Sorry about that, I am trying to catch up, and this is my last overdue assignment. I'd rather submit something I put all my efforts into than give in something sloppy and rushed.
